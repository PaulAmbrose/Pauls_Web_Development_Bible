-STATIC

  This is the default position
  Items will be stacked or inline

-RELATIVE

  Allows to move an item relative to top, bottom, left or right
      E.G
      position: relative;
      top: 40px;

      Can adjust which item is on top with:
      z-index: 1; (higher the number means
      higher up the element is placed)

-ABSOLUTE

  If you do not want it to interact with other elements
  This will place the item at the top left corner
  **note also need to change parent container from 
  static to something else, relative for example
      position: absolute;
      top: 0;
      left: 0;

-FIXED

  As absolute but always relative to view port
  and not the parent element
  So always there no matter where you scroll
      position: fixed;
      top: 0;
      left: 0;

-STICKY

  Keeps position even when scroll
