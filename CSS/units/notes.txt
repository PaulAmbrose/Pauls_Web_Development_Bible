-Pixels
    when resizing, ratio issues resolved with object-fit
        object-fit: cover;

-Percentages
    To actively resize based on parent element
        display: flex;
        align-item: center;

        width: 50%;

    Also used for border-radius

-Viewport-based unity
    view height is height of the viewing window
    100 is 100%
        height: 100vh;

    Can sent font size with view height
    font size will be relative to window size

-Rems and Ems
    1 rem = 16px and can be used instead of Pixels  
        font-size: 1rem;
    why use? Rem is relative to route element
    and can be adjusted relatively, based on browser
    settings our root.  i.e. 20px in root is 1rem
    and 2rem would therefore be 40px.

    em? - like rem but relative to parent element

    can be used to create adaptive font and padding

-Character Units
    When want to limit flexible size of a paragraph
        max-width: 50ch;

    relative to the width of the 0 character regardless
    of font size or style
